# Object-oriented programming

## Classes and objects
*Notebook* : classes_objects.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : acounts.json, log_transaction.json
Quite a classic though. I remember this exercise from my training on the way to be a Data Engineer. The bonus part of transferring funds to another account and to log each transaction. It's really an enrichment. I added some enhancements as it was not asked for this exercise : add an account file to save the current status of each account (the related functions create_account and update_account). You will see in log_transaction.json, all the failed attempts before I make all of it work.
