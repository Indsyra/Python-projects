Now we are moving at another pace: 2 lessons a day.

Working with Python 3.11.8

## Reading and Writing files
*Notebook* : writing_files.ipynb, reading_files.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : recipe.txt, sample.txt, daily_journal.txt
Nothing new compared to the lesson in Back to Basics. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.

## CSV Files
*Notebook* : csv_files.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : students.csv, students_report.csv, students_output.csv, students_output_b.csv
Enjoyed this lesson. csv.DictReader and csv.DictWriter are quite nice discoveries for me.
The program on Student Generator Report with the latitude of implementing grade definition according to the average score was another way to implement list comprehension (Done in Back to Basics)

## JSON Files
*Notebook* : date_time_countdown_timer.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : json_data, my_tasks.json, tasks.json
What a lesson! I have to admit that I truly enjoyed working on the lesson project "The Mini To-Do List". Having already worked with Json in my career, this is a practical real-world usage, knowing that sometimes I can be messy in my planning. I am thrilled to see how this can be enhanced throughout the 100-Projects challenge.

## API
*Notebook* : date_time_countdown_timer.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : weather_records.json
It's always a pleasure to perform API requests then to browse the response content. The Weather App API project aimed to display current weather only. The teacher wanted to go further by save weather records in a file and check the weather forecast for the next five days

## Date and time
*Notebook* : date_time_countdown_timer.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : event.json
Often used in my career, I mostly learned from the project on countdown timer which help me discovering "divmod" which I didn't know up to now. The two lines int(a/b) and a%b were the ways to have quotient and remainder. I appreciated the bonus as it made me apply what has been done previously regarding to JSON files. Nevertheless, I encounter an issue on displaying once for all the end of the count down for a specific event when there are multiple events defined.

## Web Scraping
*Notebook* : web_scraping.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : search_history.json, example.html, All the topic.txt files for which topic is in search_history
This chapter closes the section of working with data. It was good to go back to basics of web scraping as I was Software Testing Engineer. This part leads me to understand furtherly how BeautifulSoup works. I enjoyed worked on the basic exercise that was given on browsing a Wikipedia Article. Bonus was to handle several topics instead of one, saving their content into a text file and track each search through a JSON file. You might notice that there are some differences in the JSON structure, it is because I noticed it was heavy to split each heading or related link into their dedicated JSON structure.
