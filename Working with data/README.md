Now we are moving at another pace: 2 lessons a day.

## Reading and Writing files
Nothing new compared to the lesson in Back to Basics. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.

# CSV Files
Enjoyed this lesson. csv.DictReader and csv.DictWriter are quite nice discoveries for me.
The program on Student Generator Report with the latitude of implementing grade definition according to the average score was another way to implement list comprehension (Done in Back to Basics)
