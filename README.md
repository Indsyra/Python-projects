# Welcome to this 100-Python Projects Challenge

This September marks one year since I transitioned from Software Quality Engineer to Data Engineer — and what a journey it's been! As I reflect on this exciting chapter, I'm taking things to the next level by committing to Python mastery.

To make it happen, I’ve challenged myself with "100 Days of Python: Build 100 Real-World Projects", a hands-on Udemy course by Dr. Vivian Aranha. It’s been incredibly rewarding to uncover new insights—even in libraries I’ve used before. Growth happens when we stretch beyond the familiar! 💡
