# GUI Programming

## TKinter App
I discover tkinter library which I never used. For this first lesson, I browse basics of creating a window, adding widgets and handling user events.

### Adding Widgets

### Simple GUI App
The project was mainly about what has been done in the lesson (cf notebook). The principal challenge was to perform the code without watching the video along - simple like ABC I would say! 

My attempt (following images) was quite simple compared to the proposed solution.

The proposed solution included a method to configure the window background which was not in the lesson. It is a way better than what I actually pictured in the beginning.

The bonus challenge consisted into adding a dropdown menu to greet with a specific language.

## Buttons and Events
Another move on GUI Programming. Going deep on Tkinter buttons was an interesting challenge.
For the bonus challenge, I used a file to save the highest value reached in the application (a good mean to practice what has been learned before).

### How buttons work
