# Back to Basics

Join me in this journey to go back to the basics of Python. It feels like going back to childhood and being taught on how to write alphabet.

This is the first steps for me to master in Python fundamentals before handling more difficult projects.

Below you'll find the sweet menu of this sweet regression. This README will rather be a journal of what amazed me rather than how you should read this repository or understanding the code (assuming that if you have a Github account, you will surely understand what are those lines.)

## Tuples and Sets
I enjoyed working on the project "List checker", especially working with sets. I discovered the operations that can be done on sets that are completely different from what we can do on lists or tuples.

## File Handling
Discovered "a" option for opening a file, that does not only append new content to a file but also creates if it does not exist.

## Functions with return value
Quite frankly, nothing new that I discovered here.

## List comprehensions
Amazed by the project on Student Grade Manager on how th list comprehension has been used to define grade on each student. I used to struggle on this list definition with multiple conditions. 

## Modules and Libraries
I think until now I didn't take time to think about the definition of module or library, I used them, even created some of them without even knowing the meaning of it.
This course is really a reset for me. I also discovered the riches of "string" library which I will not only use to convert values into string. A course that shows me the importance of going back to the basics.
