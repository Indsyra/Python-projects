# Back to Basics

Join me in this journey to go back to the basics of Python. It feels like going back to childhood and being taught on how to write alphabet.

This is the first steps for me to master in Python fundamentals before handling more difficult projects.

Below you'll find the sweet menu of this sweet regression. This README will rather be a journal of what amazed me rather than how you should read this repository or understanding the code (assuming that if you have a Github account, you will surely understand what are those lines.)

Working with Python 3.11.8

## Tuples and Sets
*Notebook* : tuples_sets.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
I enjoyed working on the project "List checker", especially working with sets. I discovered the operations that can be done on sets that are completely different from what we can do on lists or tuples.

## File Handling
*Notebook* : file_handling.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : notes.txt, myNotes.txt
Discovered "a" option for opening a file, that does not only append new content to a file but also creates if it does not exist.

## Functions with return value
*Notebook* : functions_return.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Quite frankly, nothing new that I discovered here.

## List comprehensions
*Notebook* : lists_comprehension.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Amazed by the project on Student Grade Manager on how th list comprehension has been used to define grade on each student. I used to struggle on this list definition with multiple conditions. 

## Modules and Libraries
*Notebook* : modules_libraries.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* : greetings.py
I think until now I didn't take time to think about the definition of module or library, I used them, even created some of them without even knowing the meaning of it.
This course is really a reset for me. I also discovered the riches of "string" library which I will not only use to convert values into string. A course that shows me the importance of going back to the basics.

## Dictionaries
*Notebook* : dictionaries.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Oops, I've missed this module. On my side, nothing I didn't know.

## Crash Course
*Notebook* : firstcode.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Who starts a lesson from the middle ? Guess what ? Me! 
Alright, so I needed to go back to the beginning of this challenge. Baby steps! I enjoyed the game I developed Mini Game : Guess Number.

## Print Statements & Hello World
*Notebook* : print_hello_world.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Hellloooo World! I'm sure you know at least one song with this title, right? It's good to start with the Python (and any other languages') ABC. I can confess that I cheated a bit since I learned datetime before engaging the bonus challenge of this day.

## Variables and types
*Notebook* : variable_datatypes.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
It always feels good when we eat our childhood favorite meal right? Well, guess working on variables and data types feels the same. The bonus challenge of this day was quite funny especially on the nickname generator.

## User input & String formatting
*Notebook* : user_input_string_formatting.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Good old calculator with a menu! Nothing much to say on this part as it combines all the previous lessons.

## If-Else statements
*Notebook* : if_else.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
I appreciated the project especially the bonus challenge of adding the third number. I'm questioning though about the complexity of the code. Hope that I will learn to tackle this throughout the following days.

## Loops
*Notebook* : loop.ipynb
*Related Files in assets folder* :
Well, I guess working on more complex projects before coming back to this lesson made this lesson less challenging. But eh, 100 projects are 100 projects, not less not more.
